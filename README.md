# In Situ Lymphatic Imaging System (ISLIS)
Here you will find LabView VIs used in the following two papers:

[Dual-channel in-situ optical imaging system for quantifying lipid uptake and lymphatic pump function (2012)](http://biomedicaloptics.spiedigitallibrary.org/article.aspx?articleid=1352568 "Dual-channel in-situ optical imaging system for quantifying lipid uptake and lymphatic pump function (2012)")

[Postprandial lymphatic pump function after a high-fat meal: a characterization of contractility, flow, and viscosity (2016)](http://ajpgi.physiology.org/content/310/10/G776 "Postprandial lymphatic pump function after a high-fat meal: a characterization of contractility, flow, and viscosity (2016)")

Usage instructions will be updated soon.
