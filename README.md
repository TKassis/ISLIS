# In Situ Lymphatic Imaging System (ISLIS)
LabVIEW VIs used in the following two papers by _Kassis et al._:

1. [Dual-channel in-situ optical imaging system for quantifying lipid uptake and lymphatic pump function (2012)](http://biomedicaloptics.spiedigitallibrary.org/article.aspx?articleid=1352568 "Dual-channel in-situ optical imaging system for quantifying lipid uptake and lymphatic pump function (2012)")
2. [Postprandial lymphatic pump function after a high-fat meal: a characterization of contractility, flow, and viscosity (2016)](http://ajpgi.physiology.org/content/310/10/G776 "Postprandial lymphatic pump function after a high-fat meal: a characterization of contractility, flow, and viscosity (2016)")

## Installation
These LabVIEW VIs were originally written in LabVIEW 2014. I have recently upgraded them to version 2017. You need the following installed in order to use them:

1. LabVIEW 2017 (or another compatible version)
2. NI Vision Development Module 2017 (or another compatible version)

## Usage
_Will be updated soon as I'm improving the code a bit_
